# Multilayer Perceptron

A multilayer perceptron is a fully connected feed forward network. It is considered as vanille version of Neural Network and is a powerful algorithm used for basic 
Deep Learning problems.

To get deep understanding, different architectures with different hyperparameters were tweeked.
